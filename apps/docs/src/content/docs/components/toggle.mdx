## Overview

The Toggle component is a specialized theme switcher button. It features individual icons for "Sun" (light mode) and "Moon" (dark mode), and is designed to integrate with a global theme management system.

## Installation

<InstallationCli value="opscli add toggle" />

## Usage

<ComponentPreviewTabs
  component={<ToggleUsage />}
  source={
    <ComponentSource
      src="src/components/docs/Toggle.tsx"
      title="Toggle.tsx"
      language="tsx"
    />
  }
  className="lg:w-[55vw] w-[90vw]"
  align="center"
/>

## Features

<Callout type="info">
  Key features of the Toggle component:
  - **Dual State Icons**: Contains both Sun and Moon SVGs with themed coloring.
  - **Modern Styling**: Rounded-full pill design with integrated borders and padding.
  - **Theme Ready**: Pre-configured with data attributes (`data-theme-toggle`) for easy script integration.
  - **Accessible**: Includes `aria-label` for screen readers and `aria-hidden` attributes for decorative icons.
</Callout>

## Best Practices

1. **Placement**: Typically placed in the top-right corner of the application or within a fixed sidebar.
2. **Smooth Transitions**: Ensure that the theme switch itself is accompanied by a CSS transition to avoid jarring visual jumps.
3. **Accessibility**: Always provide an `aria-label` like "Toggle Theme" to ensure users of assistive technologies understand the button's purpose.
