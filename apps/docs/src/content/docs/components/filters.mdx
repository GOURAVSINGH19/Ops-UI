## Overview

The Filters component (internal name `Upgradecluster`) is a high-level orchestration component. It combines the `Header`, `MultipleFilter`, `FilterChip`, and `Pagination` components into a unified workflow for managing cluster upgrades. It handles data fetching, local filtering logic, and expanded row views for detailed build histories.

## Installation

<InstallationCli value="opscli add filters" />

## Usage

<ComponentPreviewTabs
  component={<FiltersUsage />}
  source={
    <ComponentSource
      src="src/components/docs/Filters.tsx"
      title="Filters.tsx"
      language="tsx"
    />
  }
  className="lg:w-[55vw] w-[90vw]"

## Features

<Callout type="info">
  Key features of the Filters component:
  - **Unified Interface**: Integrates multiple atoms and molecules into a cohesive dashboard.
  - **Complex Filtration**: Supports dual-stage filtering across version, provider, and lifecycle status.
  - **Integrated Pagination**: Smart pagination that resets when filters are adjusted.
  - **Expandable Details**: Interactive rows that expand to show a history of previous builds.
  - **URL Synchronization**: Persists filter state into the URL query parameters (account_id integration).
  - **Global Reset**: Single-click action to clear all active filters and search states.
</Callout>

## Best Practices

1. **Composition**: Treat this as a template for large-scale data management views.
2. **State Management**: Use `useMemo` for derived data (like unique versions or cloud providers) to ensure performant filtering.
3. **Skeleton Loading**: Provide a clear loading state while data is being fetched to reduce perceived latency.
4. **Responsive Strategy**: Ensure the grid of filters and the data list adapt gracefully to mobile screens.
